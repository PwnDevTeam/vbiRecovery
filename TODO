TODO's for vbiRecovery.

Currently we gotta do following:

	-	Make uploading files, couldn't be that hard, atleast not when TRYING to program lmfao.
	
	- 	Uploading payload, could be easily done if uploading files subroutine is coded. (CnP job kindof)
	
	-	A better shell (get iBoot data like the original one)
	
	-	Enter Recovery mode command ( Could be done by using iTunesMobileDevice.dll )
